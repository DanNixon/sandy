# Sandy [![CI](https://github.com/DanNixon/sandy/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DanNixon/sandy/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A simple-ish, general purpose "launch X in in a sandbox" tool that uses [Bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) under the hood.

Not at all ready for production and should be considered experimental at best.
